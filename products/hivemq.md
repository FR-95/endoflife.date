> [HiveMQ] (https://www.hivemq.com/hivemq/mqtt-broker/) is an MQTT broker and a client based
> messaging platform designed for the fast, efficient and reliable movement of data to and from
> connected IoT devices. It uses the MQTT protocol for instant, bidirectional push of data between
> your device and your enterprise systems.

Starting with HiveMQ 4.10, feature releases for the HiveMQ Enterprise MQTT Platform take on a
monthly schedule. HiveMQ ships a new version of the platform every month, each monthly release
includes a mix of major and minor features. Shorter release cycles help to benefit from new
functionality as soon as possible

Two Release Types:

1. Rolling releases; Offered monthly with a combination of new features and maintenance releases.
2. LTS (Long Term Support) releases; Offered every 18 months and requires customers to upgrade from
   the previous LTS.

The releases follow this [convention] (https://www.hivemq.com/blog/hivemq-moves-to-new-release-cadence/)
below:

| Type                           | Version Name |
|--------------------------------|--------------|
| HiveMQ Release                 | 4.x          |
| HiveMQ LTS Release             | 4.x.0-LTS    |
| HiveMQ LTS Maintenance Release | 4.x.y-LTS    |

*[LTS]: Long Term Support
